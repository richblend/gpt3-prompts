## Experiment: Using GPT-3 for development tasks

A collection of example prompts that can be used to explore GPT-3's capabilities. Although results are sometimes mixed, and some of these tasks could probably be performed more automatically by simpler methods, there are still some interesting use cases. 

Use these examples as starting points for your own experiments!

How could we use GPT-3 to help us with our development tooling? OpenAI has a [simple API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) that allows us to build our own tools.

These examples be used in the OpenAi playground here: https://beta.openai.com/playground (Free, although signup required).
