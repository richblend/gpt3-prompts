### Using OpenAi to create and incrementally modify an SVG


Paste the results into [https://jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/) to see the SVG.

```
The following SVG snippet will render a diagram with several nodes depicted as circles, each corresponding to a major character from the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. There will exist nodes for Romeo, Juliet, Friar Lawrence, and the Nurse, and each will have a text label with the character's name.
```

```
Now, we modify this diagram to draw a line connecting Romeo and Juliet, and use black text instead of white.
```
